### Summary

* Postdoctoral Teaching Associate in the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.cmu.edu/math/index.html) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)
* Ph.D. in Mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in the analysis of the [Navier-Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) (unfortunately, haven't solved the [million dollar Millennium problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness) yet)
* Particularly interested in quantitative modeling, statistical analysis and applications of deep learning algorithms to solve real-world data-driven problems 
* Actively seeking **quantitative research** and **data science** positions to apply my analytical expertise and leadership skills
* My resume is available upon request by ([email](mailto:jkoganem@gmail.com)), please feel free to reach out as I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations

### ‚òï About Me

* **Machine Learning practitioner**: I have been working on data-driven projects using statistical and machine learning techniques and have experience training and deploying deep learning models in PyTorch and TensorFlow (see [Past Projects](#-past-projects) below)
* **Passionate mentor and educator**: I have taught over 500+ students as an instructor at Carnegie Mellon and mentored numerous undergraduate students in summer research projects. I strive to create a supportive learning environment and for all my students to succeed in their academic and professional careers

* **Detailed oriented researcher**: my research involves the analysis of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), often requiring meticulous derivation of a priori estimates combined with deep ideas from Functional Analysis 

For more about my research, please check out [these slides](./equadiff2024-slides.pdf) from a talk I gave at the [Equadiff conference](https://www.kau.se/en/equadiff-2024/about-conference) in Karlstad, Sweden. A more thorough introduction to my research can be found in the first part of [my thesis](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Traveling_wave_solutions_to_the_free_boundary_incompressible_Navier-Stokes_equations/24053892?file=42184224).
