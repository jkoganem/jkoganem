### Summary

* Postdoctoral Teaching Associate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.cmu.edu/math/index.html) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/)
* Ph.D. in Mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in the analysis of the [Navier-Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) (unfortunately, haven't solved the [million dollar Millennium problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_existence_and_smoothness) yet)
* Particularly interested in quantitative modeling, statistical analysis and applications of deep learning algorithms to solve real-world data-driven problems 
* Actively seeking **quantitative research** and **data science** positions to apply my analytical expertise and leadership skills
* My resume is available upon request ([email](mailto:jkoganem@gmail.com)) and I am open to new opportunities and collaborations

### ‚òï About Me

* **Detailed oriented researcher**: my research involves the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations, often requiring meticulous derivation of a priori estimates combined with deep ideas from Functional Analysis 
* **Machine Learning practitioner**: I have been working on data-driven projects using statistical and machine learning techniques and have experience training and deploying deep learning models in PyTorch and TensorFlow (see [Past Projects](#-past-projects) below)
* **Passionate mentor and educator**: I have taught over 500+ students as an instructor at Carnegie Mellon and mentored numerous undergraduate students in summer research projects. I strive to create a supportive learning environment and for all my students to succeed in their academic and professional careers


### ü§î Current Projects

* Developing a new course on modern applications of Linear Algebra to Engineering, Data Science, and Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University [[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/jkoganem/Teaching-Advanced-Linear-Algebra-21366)]
